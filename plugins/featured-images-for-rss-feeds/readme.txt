Adds featured images from posts to your site's RSS feed output, with image size and CSS positioning options.

== Description ==

A simple way to add featured images in your site's RSS feed, with easy size and positioning options, and now supports custom sizes as well.

Works great with Feedburner, Chimpfeedr, and Mailchimp's RSS-to-Email campaigns, with the featured images added to the left or centered above the text, or to the left or right of the text with word wrap, and with thumbnail, medium, large, full, or custom sizes. It's WordPress Multisite compatible, simply Network Activate to add featured images to all your site's RSS feeds, with each site having it's own size and positioning settings. It defaults to thumbnail sizes with left above text positioning.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are there any FAQs? =

Not really right now... the use and options are pretty self-explainatory. I'm sure this will change over time. ;) Use the Support tab to submit your questions or concerns please.
